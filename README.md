</p>

## What is dAgora ?
dAgora is a community service that helps with the creation, collection, and reconstruction of content.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies with `yarn install` and launch the project with `npm run dev`. 

The mentioned commands will open a `http://localhost:3000/` tab in your browser.

## Serve with discord bot
The discord bot [cori](https://github.com/DDAO-community/Cori) can collect messages and push them to [crossbell](https://crossbell.io/feed).

## How it works?
1. DAO members can feed the messages in discord to the bot'Cori', and the data will be stored on chain.
2. Members can browse/subscribe the contents by community, address, tag, time, etc via the web page.
3. The viewer collects the content they like by minting it as NFT.
