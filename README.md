# ANS UI
[ANS](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS) (Arweave Name Service) is a domain protocol built on Arweave.

## Hackathon
The official ANS Hackathon is starting on September 9th. Join us in building the UI for this project to get a slice of the **REDACTED** prize pool! [More info here](https://github.com/decentldotland/ANS_UI_2.0/tree/UI2.0/components_new/user/hackathon)
P.S the prize for the first place is REDACTED ðŸ¤¯.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies with `yarn install` and launch the project with `npm run dev`. This will open a `http://localhost:3000/` tab in your browser.

## More About the UI
In its current state, the UI offers some basic read / view functionalities. If you have an ANS handle, connect your wallet and head over to your page by clicking the "profile" button (or by manually inputting the destination: `/p/<username>`).
To edit your ark Profile, connect the wallet and click the edit icon.
